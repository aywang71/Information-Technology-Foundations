	<h1>Hello! You've found the coursework folders!</h1>
	<p>The remaining Lessons and associated Labs will require you to create a database, query a database and create a program using PHP. You will pull everything together analyzing the IPO. This will require everything from developing the logic/algorithm using Flowgorithm, creating an HTML Form and possible landing page, developing a PHP program to complete the processing requirements and returning the output using HTML. 
	<p>One of the reasons we learned about HTML Forms is so that you can use this for input.  PhP also allows you to do output using HTML as well. You will use PHP to do the processing. In the last lesson we will add the database component as well. For you to test your work you will need to have XAMPP running. You will continue to use your text editor to create your files but now you will test via the URL address for XAMPP localhost.</p>
	<p>Since we will be using XAMPP to test our code it is <b><span style="color:red;">CRITICAL</span></b> that you save your file in the correct location.  Your location should be in similar to: F:\xampp\htdocs\cti110.  F: will differ because you may have a different drive letter for you usb.  What is important is <b><span style="color:#008040;">\xampp\htdocs\cti110.</span></b></p>
	
	<p> You will continue to have the same minimum requirement in your code files.  Here is a rehash.Each coding exercise will have a Description of your code using the Comment function.  Some may be already filled in but may need to be changed to reflect the correct file name and some you will need to annotate.  Standard Description Requirement on all coding exercises:</P>
		<ul>
			<li>Your Name</li>
			<li>File Name</li>
			<li>Blackboard Username</li>
			<li>Class Section: CTI.110.xxx</li>
			<li>Purpose of Code:</li>
		</ul>
		<p>  Tips that will help you be successful in remainder of this course:</p>
		<ul class="except">
			<li>Truly understand the concept of pathing (especially, the difference between a window directory and an URL address.) You can start at <a href = "https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/p/path.htm">Computer Hope -- Path</a></li>
			<li> All lab filenames without exception will start with YOUR lastname and then an identifier for the specific lab being completed. </li>
			<li> Ensure all your files are stored in the correct location so you can create and test your work.</li>
			<li> When editing your files you will use the windows directory path to save...but you will use the URL address to test. Physically they will be in the same location, however, how the file is accessed determines how the file is handled.</li>
			<li>It is critical that you have XAMPP up and running. The rest of the course will be dependent on this.  If you need help talk to your instructor and/or go to the WTCC ILC for help.  DO NOT wait on this!!!</li>
		<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> You might want to make a copy of your completed coursework in case you make mistakes or something happens since Blackboard will not have backups of those files.</p>
