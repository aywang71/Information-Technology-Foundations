  <h2> What is This Page For?</h2>
  <p>This is an index page linking to multiple folders <b>within</b> the CTI110 folder.   It also 
  contains information about you course work files, recommendations, and how to edit this page.  
  This page is a quick link to your Coursework which includes both Labs and Assignments. It has has 
  a special link to a group folder.  In this folder you can save you group work and then test your 
  part of the project. In addition, this page provides links to the PHP Homepage, and W3 Schools website. </p>

  <h2 class="about">Accessing and Testing Your Work</h2>
  <p>Make sure you have downloaded the files and placed them in the correct location and accessed 
  via a Links URLs. You can also go to them directly with the correct path.</p>
	<p>You can test HTML files using your editor or browser but you cannot do an integration test for 
  a web application without a web server and backend programming language.  You will be using XAMPP 
  to do this.  You will also use XAMPP for databases (mysql/mariaDB) and use PHPAdmin as a GUI 
  frontend to mysql/mariaDB.
  
  <p>For the remaining lessons, you will NEED a working XAMPP install and running to test. When 
  testing, simply type the URL directly, for example:</p>
	<p><cite><a href="http://localhost:8082/cti110/coursework/labs/hello-almost-done.html">
  <cite>http://localhost:8082/cti110/coursework/labs/hello-almost-done.html</cite></p>
	<p>If you did not change your ports and are using the default port (which is 80) then you would
  use: <cite><a href="http://localhost/cti110/coursework/lab/hello-intro-course.html">
  <cite>http://localhost/cti110/coursework/hello-intro-course.html</cite></p>

	<h2 id="coursework">How do I work on my coursework files?</h2>
	<p>There are basic steps to make changes to a file:</p>
	<ol>
	  <li>Start a text editor</li>
	  <li>Open the file you want to work on (or create a new file if that's what you want) and rename 
  per the lab naming convention. Generally, this will be lastname-XXXX.ext. These files need to be 
  located in the appropriate folder under your hdtocs/cti110/coursework folder.of your 
  XAMPP installation.</li>
	  <li>Edit the file as needed</li>
	  <li>Save the file (usually to the same location)</li>
	  <li>Now you can open the file in your Web browser to view your changes. To do this either return 
  to this page and click the coursework link above to navigate to the link to your file, or simply 
  type the URL directly in your browser window, 
  for example:  http://localhost:8082/cti110/coursework/lab/filename#</li>
	</ol>

	<h2 id="notes">How can I edit this page?</h2>
	<p>You can edit this file to suite your own purposes. It is located in your cto110 folder and
  named index.html. You may find it useful to add some notes of your own, or you may want to include
  more links, for example if you create additional folders (see below).</p>
	<p>You can also create additional folders if you want to develop your own work. These can be
  located under the cti110 folder or directly under the htdocs folder. Note that files that are
  located outside the htdocs folder will not be available for viewing on the Web server unless you 
  change the default document directory settings.</p>

    <li>Back-up. Make a back up of your work <strong>at least weekly</strong> to be sure you don't 
    lose code that you have worked hard on! To backup your work, copy your entire CTI110 folder to 
    another disk. </li>
    <li>If you do  not understanding pathing and the difference between url and windows directory 
    addresses look it up!</li>
    <li>Understand and always ask yourself why you do something. Do not blindly copy.</li>
